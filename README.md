# Twitter Unfollow Manager

## Project Overview
This single-page web application helps users identify and manage accounts that have recently unfollowed them on Twitter (X). It provides a clean, user-friendly interface to view unfollowers and perform bulk unfollow actions. The backend is powered by Python using Flask, and the frontend is built with a single HTML file styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

This project uses mock data to simulate Twitter API interactions for demonstration purposes, including authentication, user data fetching, and unfollow actions.

## Features
- **Mock Authentication**: Simulates Twitter login for demo purposes.
- **User Profile Display**: Shows mock user details (name, handle, avatar).
- **Unfollower List**: Lists mock accounts that have unfollowed the user.
- **Unfollow Action**: Enables bulk unfollowing of selected accounts with one click.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS for seamless desktop and mobile experiences.
